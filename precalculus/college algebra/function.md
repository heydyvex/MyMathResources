Function is an important concept in math, takes and **input** and gives an **output**.

notation: 
	$y = f(x)$ or $f(x) = y$  
	basically are the same such that $x$ is input $f$ is function and $f(x)$ and $y$ are our output.
	we read like: **f of x** is equal to **y**

all a function does that map a *x-value* to *y-value*, on graph $x$ is *x-axis* and $f(x)$ or $y$ is *y-axis*
$(x, y)$ or $(x, f(x)$

$x$ is an independent variable and $y$ is an dependent variable.

+ what does independent and dependent mean?
- well independent variable is what we choose to be and dependent variable is dependent on what independent variable **is**, (did you get the idea?)

a function always gives a constant value for a input, so called 1 to 1 function, for example if $f(1) = 4$ it should be give you only $4$ all the time for input $1$ 

Don’t misinterpret thing, if 1 and 5 gives you 4 it is totally fine but it should give you the same *OUTPUT* all the time, that's it.

for example:

Work hours | Day
--- | ---:
25 | $50
53 | $310
30 and 40 | $490

You see? 30 and 40 gives you 490 and it should always gives you 490 not a different output

Look at this table:

Work hours | Day
--- | ---:
25 | $50
30 and 53 | $310
30 and 40 | $490

Noticed? 30 give you 310 and 490, THIS IS NOT A FUNCTION, it gives you two outputs for one input, for example: 
>your employer can’t give you $490 for 30 hours for now and $310 for 30 hours later if you agreed on a rate.

##### Domain and Range

we call inputs **Domain** and output **Range**

**Domain**: Set of Inputs (X's)
**Range**: Set of Outputs (Y's)

##### examples:

S = $\{(-2, 16), (-1, 4), (0, 3), (1, 4)\}$, is all the elements is S are functions? the answer is **yes** but reflect on this to understand.

R = $\{(-2, 5), (3, 9), (5, 0), (-2, 6) \}$, this is not a function, why? Because -2 maps to two outputs so it is not.

$$y = -7x+5$$this is a function every input will give you different output.
$$2x - 4y = 8$$ we solve this for $y$ and $y = \dfrac{1}{2}x -2$ is a function.
$$$y = \pm\sqrt{3-2x}$$  this is not a function, it is obvious, because $\pm\sqrt{\hspace{1em}}$ gives you positive and negative output.

**Notice**:
if in paper you are given: $$y=\sqrt{3-2x}$$ this is a function.

but if you are given: $$y^2 = x$$ and you solve for $y$ and you get $y = \sqrt{x}$ but you have to put $\pm$ front of square root: $$y=\pm\sqrt{x}$$ and this is not a function.
