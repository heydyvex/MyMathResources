- how graph works
- how to find points on graphs

coordinate plans is used to graph functions, x-axis for $x$ or input and y-axis for $y$ or outputs
this is from Prof. Leonard YouTube channel:

we are going explore this graph.
 - what is $f(0)=?$, it is $5$, it means if $x=0, y=5$ and we write $(x, f(x))$ or $(x, y)$ and for this case $(0, 5)$.
 - what is $f(-6)=?$, it is $-3$, and $(-6, -3)$
 - is $f(3)$ Pos/Neg? it is positive
 - is $f(8)$ Pos/Neg? it is negative
 - for what $x$ is $f(x)=0$ ? $x = -4, 6, 10$
 - for what $x$ is $f(x)>0$ ? $x=-4<x<6, 10<x<11$
 - for what $x$ is $f(x)<0$ ? $x=-6<x<-4,6<x<10$
 - what is the domain? Interval of x-axis that graph covers, $D:\{x\mid -6\leq x\leq 11\}$,$[-6,11]$
 - what is range? interval of y-axis that graph covers, $D:\{y\mid -3\leq y \leq 5\}, [-3, 5]$
 - what are x-intercepts? it means when graph intercept x-axis, $(-4,0),(6,0),(10,0)$
 - what is y-intercept? there is always only one y-intercept, $(0,5)$
 - how many times does y=2 cross the graph? $2$
 - for what $x$ does $f(x)=3$ ? $(-2, 3), (4, 3)$
 - for what x does $f(x)=-3$ ? $(-6,-3),(8,-3)$

what the domains and ranges are?

$$
\begin{align}{}
&\text{for (a):}\\[2pt] &D:\{x\mid 0\leq x\leq4\},[0,4]\\[2pt] &R:\{y\mid 0\leq y\leq2\},[0, 2]\\[20pt]
&\text{for (b):}\\[2pt] &D:\{x\mid 0\leq x\leq4\},[0,4]\\[2pt] &R:\{y\mid -2\leq y\leq2\},[-2, 2]\\[20pt]
&\text{for (c):}\\[2pt] &D:\{x\mid -1\leq x\leq6\},[-1,6]\\[2pt] &R:\{y\mid -2\leq y\leq1\},[-2, 1]\\[20pt]
&\text{for (d):}\\[2pt] &D:\{x\mid-4\leq x\leq2\},[-4,2]\\[2pt] &R:\{y\mid -2\leq y\leq4\},[-2, 4]\\[20pt]
\end{align}
